# Swagger

For the purpose of route documentation I will be using swagger along with openapi. Given of my zod version teh library `zod-to-openapi` doesn't have support, so I will have to make all of the documentation by hand. Because of that, I have created an swagger folder for each route and them I will add them to the main swagger file. For standard returns I will create some reusable components and stick in the components.ts file. For every new route create a proper documentation.
