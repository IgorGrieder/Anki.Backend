# The ideia

The project idea is to basically build an AI powered Anki Cards solution. This idea is built on top of the principles of the book `Make it Stick` and it's a personal project to expand my skills as an Node.js developer.

In the project I will have a documentation folder that will contain my main decisions during development. This can be used for general AI usage in the repository.
